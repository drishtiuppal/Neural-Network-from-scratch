# Neural-Network-from-scratch

Welcome to the Single Neuron Neural Network project! In this repository, we explore the fundamental concepts of neural networks by implementing a single neuron neural network both from scratch and using TensorFlow. We compare the results obtained from both implementations to understand the nuances and intricacies of neural network development.

# Dataset Information
The insurance dataset used in this project contains information about individuals including their age, affordability score, and whether they bought insurance.

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to gain a deeper understanding of neural network operations by building a basic model from scratch. By comparing the results with a well-established framework like TensorFlow, we aim to comprehend the underlying mechanisms and appreciate the convenience and power offered by such libraries.

# Features
Single Neuron Implementation: Develop a single neuron neural network architecture from scratch.
TensorFlow Implementation: Utilize TensorFlow to create a similar neural network structure.
Comparison: Conduct a thorough comparison of results obtained from both implementations.

# Results
The results obtained from both implementations are compared and analyzed in the 'Neural Network from scratch' Jupyter Notebook. Feel free to explore the notebook to delve deeper into the findings.
